		<h2>About Your Insides</h2>
		<p>Your digestive system - made up of your mouth, stomach, and colon - helps you absorb food.</p>
		<p>Your colon, like other parts of your body, can get cancer. Colon cancers often begin as non-cancerous polyps. A polyp is a small growth on the surface of your colon that can turn into cancer. Removing polyps may prevent you from getting colon cancer.</p>
