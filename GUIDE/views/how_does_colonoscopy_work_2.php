		<h2>How does a colonoscopy work?</h2>

		<p>The endoscope is a thin, flexible tube that has a light and a camera at the tip. Images from the camera go to a TV monitor, allowing the doctor to see the inside of your colon. The doctor will look for polyps and remove any that are found. This usually takes 20-30 minutes.</p>
