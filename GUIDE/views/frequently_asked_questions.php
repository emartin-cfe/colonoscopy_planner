		<h2 class="top">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

		<h2>Can I drive myself home after my colonoscopy?</h2>
		<p>NO. You will receive medicine to make you sleepy during the test: that means you will be impaired. Please have an adult drive and escort you home.</p>

		<h2>How long will the procedure take?</h2>
		<p>The colonoscopy itself takes about 10-30 minutes. But, expect to spend 2-3 hours at your facility, as you'll need to prepare for and recover from your test.</p>

		<h2>What are the side effects of the <?=$bowel_prep?>?</h2>
		<p>You will have lots of diarrhea from the bowel prep. This will start anywhere from a few minutes to three hours after you start your prep. So plan to be home, and plan to be near a toilet. Most people have bloating and abdominal cramping. This is normal. Do not be alarmed if you feel these symptoms. Many people have nausea. This is also normal. Do not let the taste or smell of the medicine get in the way of taking the medicine as directed. Rarely, some people throw up while taking the prep. If this happens, stop taking the prep and call your doctor.</p> 

		<h2>My prep hasn't started working yet. Is that OK?</h2>
		<p>Different people respond differently to the bowel prep - some people start having diarrhea within minutes of taking the prep, while others need an hour or more. Be sure you are drinking enough of the <span class="image_popup"><a class="image_popup" href="images/drinks_ok.png" title="Please only drink clear fluids such as water, apple juice, and clear chicken broth.">right type of clear fluids</a>. If that doesn't work, take the second part of your prep and continue to drink fluids. It should work eventually. Call your GI doctor if the medicine is still not working at all after 3 hours despite drinking clear fluids.</p>
