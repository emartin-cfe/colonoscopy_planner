		<h2 class="top">ONE DAY Before Your Colonoscopy</h2>

		<h2>What You Eat:</h2>
		<p>You must not eat any <span class="image_popup"><a class="image_popup" href="images/foods_not_ok.png" title="Solid food makes it hard for the GI doctor to see inside.">solid foods</a> the day before your colonoscopy. You may only drink a <span class="image_popup"><a class="image_popup" href="images/drinks_ok.png" title="Do NOT drink cloudy liquids: it will make it hard for the GI doctor to see inside.">clear liquid diet</a>.</p>

		<h2>What You Drink:</h2>
		<p>You must drink only clear liquids for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Be sure to drink at least 12 tall glasses (about 8-10 ounces each) of clear liquids throughout the day in addition to what you drink with your bowel prep.</p>

		<h2>Taking Your Prep:</h2>
		<p>By the day before your test you should already have your "bowel prep" medicine. If not, call your doctor. The instructions for your prep are located inside the prep box. <b>You will start taking your prep at 6:00 p.m. the evening before your test</b>. Follow the directions carefully. How do you know if your prep is working? Look at this <span class="image_popup"><a class="image_popup" href="images/when_is_bowel_complete.png" title="You're done when the stool coming out is yellow, light, liquid, and clear - like urine.">example</a> to find out.</span></p>

		<p>Some doctors want you to take the whole prep the night before your test. But many doctors prescribe a "split prep." A "split prep" means you will take half of the prep the evening before the test, and the other half the day of the test. Check the instructions from your doctor.</p>

		<p>If your doctor prescribed a "split prep," then you will take the <b>first</b> part of your prep at 6:00 p.m. the evening before your test, and you will take the <b>second</b> part of the prep the morning of your test starting four hours before the scheduled time of your colonoscopy.</p>
