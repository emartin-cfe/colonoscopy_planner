		<h2>Imagine This</h2>

		<p>Think of it this way: a clean colon is like driving on a country road on a sunny day. A dirty colon is like driving in a snowstorm.</p>

		<div class="colon_container">
			<img class="colon_images" align="right" src="images/clean_colon.png" alt="some_text"/>
			<br/><br/>
			<p>When your colon is clean, doing the colonoscopy is like driving on a country road on a sunny day. It is easy to see and to drive.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="colon_container_2">
			<img class="colon_images" align="right" src="images/dirty_colon.png" alt="some_text">
			<br/><br/><br/>
			<p>When your colon is dirty, doing the colonoscopy is like driving on a winter road in a snow storm. It is hard to see and hard to drive.</p>
		</div>
