		<h2 class="top">DAY of Your Colonoscopy</h2>

		<h2>What You Eat:</h2>
		<p>You must not eat any solid foods prior to your colonoscopy, even if your colonoscopy is scheduled for the afternoon. You can eat a regular diet after the test is over.</p>

		<h2>What You Drink:</h2>
		<p>You must drink only clear liquids before your colonoscopy. Be sure to drink at least two tall glasses (at least 8-10 ounces each) of clear sports drink with electrolytes prior to your colonoscopy.</p>

		<h2>Taking Your Prep:</h2>
		<p>If your doctor ordered a "split prep," then you must take the second part of your prep the morning of your test. Be sure to take it four hours before your test, even if that means having to get up very early. For example, if your doctor prescribed a "split prep" and your test is scheduled for 1:00 p.m., then take the second part of your prep at 9:00 a.m. the morning of your test. If your procedure is earlier in the morning, then this means you will have to get up very early to take this second part of your prep. We know it is hard to get up this early, but it is very important that you take the second part of your prep four hours before your colonoscopy in order for the prep to work.</p>
