		<h2>How Does A Colonoscopy Work?</h2>
		<p>The purpose of a colonoscopy is to look inside your colon for polyps, cancers, ulcers, and other conditions. It is important to get a colonoscopy to test for colon cancer once you are 45-50 years of age or older since the disease usually has no symptoms.</p>
		<p>Just before the procedure starts, you will receive some medicine to make you sleepy. This medicine (a sedative) will help you avoid discomfort from the procedure. Most people do not remember having the procedure.</p>
		<p>The doctor will begin the colonoscopy with a rectal examination. The doctor will then insert the scope into the anus and as it's advanced, the doctor will inflate the bowel with a stream of air to allow better visualization of the surface.</p>
