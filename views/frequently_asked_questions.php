		<h2 class="top">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

		<h2>Can I drive myself home after my colonoscopy?</h2>
		<p>NO. You will receive medicine to make you sleepy during the test. That means you cannot drive home. You must arrange for someone to drive you home after the test. You may also take a taxi or bus, but only if you have an adult who can escort you home.</p>

		<h2>How long will the test take?</h2>
		<p>The test itself takes about 10-30 minutes. But, expect to spend more time at the doctors' since you'll need to prepare for and recover from your test. Expect to spend about 2-3 hours at your facility, although this may vary.</p>

		<h2>What are the side effects of the "bowel prep"?</h2>
		<p>You will have lots of diarrhea from the bowel prep. This will start anywhere from a few minutes to three hours after you start your prep. So plan to be home, and plan to be near a toilet. Most people have bloating and abdominal discomfort. This is normal. Do not be alarmed if you feel these symptoms. Many people have nausea. This is also normal. Some people do not like the taste or smell of the medicine. Please do not let this get in the way of taking the medicine as directed. Rarely, some people throw up while taking the prep. If this happens, stop taking the prep and call your doctor.</p> 

		<h2>My prep hasn't started working yet. Is that OK?</h2>
		<p>Different people respond differently to the bowel prep - some people start having diarrhea within minutes of taking the prep, while others need an hour or more. Be sure you are drinking enough <span class="image_popup"><a class="image_popup" href="images/drinks_ok.png" title="Please only drink clear fluids such as water, apple juice, and clear chicken broth.">of the right type of fluids</a>. If that doesn't work, take the second part of your prep and continue to drink fluids. It should work eventually. Call your GI doctor if the medicine is still not working at all after 3 hours despite drinking fluids.</p>
