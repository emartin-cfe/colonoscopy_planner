		<h2>About This Guide</h2>
		<p>You've been scheduled for a colonoscopy. <b>Colonoscopy can find cancer and save lives.</b> This guide will help you get ready. We know it can be challenging to get ready for a colonoscopy. We created this guide to help answer your questions.</p>
		<p>Please carefully read these instructions, as you will more likely have a successful colonoscopy.</p>

		<h2>Preparing for your colonoscopy</h2>
		<p>The MOST IMPORTANT thing you can do is to <b>empty your colon by following the diet described in this guide and taking the "bowel prep" medication recommended by your doctor</b>. We want to help you get ready. If you come in with your colon properly cleaned out, then we can make this "one and done". "One and done" means just that - let's do this once, let's do it right, and let's be done with it. Then we won't run the risk and inconvenience of having to come back and repeat the test.</p>
