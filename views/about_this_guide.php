		<h2>About This Guide</h2>
		<p>You've been scheduled for a colonoscopy. <b>Colonoscopy can find cancer and save lives.</b> This guide will help you get ready. We know it can be challenging to get ready for a colonoscopy. We also know that you may have questions about the test. We created this guide to help answer your questions. You should then print off and complete the checklist provided at the end of this guide as you prepare for your procedure.</p>
		<p>Please carefully read these instructions, as you will more likely have a successful colonoscopy.</p>

		<h2>Preparing for your colonoscopy</h2>
		<p>The MOST IMPORTANT thing you can do is to <b>empty your colon by following the diet described in this guide and taking the "bowel prep" medication recommended by your doctor</b>. We want to help you get ready. If you come in with your colon properly cleaned out, then we can make this "one and done". "One and done" means just that - let's do this once, let's do it right, and let's be done with it. Then we won't run the risk and inconvenience of having to come back and repeat the test.</p>
